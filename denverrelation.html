                Denver and Moscow have done heists together. Moscow describes their relationship as "just like the Sacapuntas Duo, but with burglaries." Denver originally wasn't supposed to be part of the heist plan, but after Moscow finds out that Denver is in debt and owed money to violent drug dealers, he talks the Professor into allowing Denver to take part in the heist. Moscow's goal was to earn enough money for him and Denver to live in a country whose name they can't even pronounce and spend their days drinking mojitos by beaches. After hearing that Denver killed a hostage, Moscow is distraught and believes that by bringing his son to the heist, he turned his son into a murderer.
