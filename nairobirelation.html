                Initially, Bogotá and Nairobi banter with one another. When he says something sexist and Nairobi stands up for herself, he is smitten. He falls in love with Nairobi, but Nairobi tells him she wouldn't even touch him with a 10-foot pole. Yet, when she gets shot initially in the lung and has surgery, Bogotá is by her bedside throughout her recovery ensuring she is safe. While she is still asleep from the surgery, he prepares a means of transportation for her as he knows it will be difficult for her to walk and she will want to be involved in the heist still. This expresses how much he cares for Nairobi. When she wakes up, he confesses his love for her by saying he can imagine her dressed in white saying "suck dick." She reciprocates these feelings and they share an intimate moment looking into one another's eyes.

                Post surgery and their visit to the team working on melting the gold, Nairobi and Bogotá are alone in an elevator together.

She mocks him, saying "You call that a kiss?" Nairobi gets up with the help of Bogotá and they share a passionate kiss in the elevator.
