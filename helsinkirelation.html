            <p><font color="#738ADB">Oslo</font><br>
                Helsinki is Oslo's cousin, and together they fought in wars. Helsinki and Oslo are close, having traveled and done work together for a while before they are recruited by the Professor. Oslo trusts Helsinki enough to request Helsinki to kill him when he is put in a vegetive state.

            <p><font color="#738ADB">Nairobi</font><br>
                Helsinki and Nairobi have always had a good relationship. Nairobi and Helsinki were paired together after the Royal Mint of Spain Heist, and spent time in eastern Europe. In fact, Nairobi fell in love and wanted to start a family with him.

            <p><font color="#738ADB">Palermo</font><br>
                During the planning of the second heist, Palermo and Helsinki developed a physical relationship. Due to his heartbreak from Berlin, Palermo decided not to let anyone else come close emotionally, including Helsinki, whereas Helsinki had supposedly fallen in love with him. Whether Palermo loved him back is not given much attention. Later on in the show, Helsinki manages to break through his façade as their relationship grows.

            <p><font color="#738ADB">Arturo Román</font><br>
                Helsinki likes to make Arturo nervous, often belittling him by calling him "Arturito". In the last hours of the robbery, he covered him with fake explosives to scare him.
