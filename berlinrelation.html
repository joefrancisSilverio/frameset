                    During the heist at the Royal Mint of Spain, Berlin meets Ariadna Cascales, an employee of the mint who is taken hostage. Early in the heist, when Ariadna trembles in fear, Berlin approaches her to tell her than he is not a monster. Later, when she and four other girls are sent to a room and she witnesses her fellow hostages being intimidated and taken away, Ariadna begins to panic. Fearing for her life, she asks to speak privately with Berlin. In an office, she "seduces" him, thinking that it will increase her odds of surviving the heist. They regularly have sex, which Ariadna describes to MÃ³nica as rape. In return, Berlin provides her with tranquilizers. Ariadna confesses that Berlin has plans to marry her, but she only intends to stay with him for survival and to get a portion of the heist money.[6] Nairobi later reveals this information to Berlin.

                    Out of all the people in the crew, Berlin is one of the people that Tokyo disliked the most. She had defied and challenged him on multiple occasions throughout the show, even going so far as to hold him at gunpoint to get him to do what she wanted. The height of her aggression with Berlin was when she played Russian Roulette with him in the bathroom, which drove Berlin to tie her to a cart and push her out of the Royal Mint.

                    Palermo was in love with his best friend Berlin for ten years, so much so that he suffered severely from depression after his death, turning to alcohol as a coping mechanism. They had met prior to the show's events, and the two came up with the Bank of Spain heist together.

                    One evening, after talking to his brother about the Bank of Spain heist, Berlin went into Palermo's room and woke him up to tell him that he told Sergio about the plan, and that he thought it was amazing. The two then go to tell Sergio about their plan to get the gold out.

                    Some time before the Royal Mint of Spain heist, Berlin admits to knowing that Palermo loves him, which Palermo brushes off. Berlin confesses that he's never felt anything with any of the women he's been with that's remotely similar to what he has with Palermo. He calls them soulmates, but only 99% as he likes women a lot, and the 1% defines his desire. Palermo questions what's 99% to 1%, and then kisses Berlin, before asking him if he's a coward. Berlin then pushes him against a wall, and they passionately kiss, before Berlin parts with him and says that he would do anything to feel "this". He professes his love to Palermo, before saying how his brother is right and that they have to part ways and scrap the plan. Before leaving, he says that time will eventually bring them back together.

                    During an argument, Nairobi accuses Palermo of being so weak that he has never been able to tell Berlin that he is in love with him.
