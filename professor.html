            The Professor, real name Sergio, mostly grew up in hospitals due to being a sick child. He leads the gang, and is the one who carefully plans and organises the heist in the Royal Mint and the Bank of Spain. He is sophisticated but nerdy. The idea of the first heist is to avenge his father, whose idea it originally was.

            Sergio is highly intelligent and meticulous. He appears to be very determined to pull off the greatest money heists in history, after planning for it for several years. Once he recruits his dream team, he makes everyone religiously follow a strict schedule, complete with fundamental rules to prepare for and execute the heist. His perfectionist attitude is apparent through his careful consideration and planning for all possible scenarios that could arise during the heist. This forward-thinking approach helps him in his strive for perfection, where he urges the team to 'stick to the plan' in every situation.

            The Professor appears to have exceptional knowledge in negotiation tactics, police strategy, weaponry, law enforcement, hostage crises aversion, forgery, theft and bank robberies. He was able to control the entirety of the heist from behind the scenes, playing with the police and constantly tricking them into doing exactly what he wanted them to do. He also demonstrates a deep understanding of human psychology. A majority of his plans gravely depend upon the reactions he predicts from the police, the government, and the public. This allows him to play a tense game of one-upmanship with Inspector Raquel Murillo, where he repeatedly manages to shift the status quo in favor of his team during the heist, despite overwhelming odds.

            His calm demeanor complements his innate leadership traits, which allows him to resolve team conflicts without a fuss. Moreover, team members have great trust in his plans and decision-making ability. This is apparent when the team chooses to respect the protocol of waiting for 24 hours for his phone telephone call before activating 'Plan Chernobyl', despite clear evidence on the television of his impending imprisonment a few hours before the deadline. They do this as they have immense respect for his intellect and believe he will do everything in his power to save the team from any crisis.

            Sergio also thinks of himself as a strategist similar to a chess-player, who needs to carefully calculate every move before arriving at a conclusion. This allows him to make crucial decisions in very short periods of time when situations go awry. He may possibly be an expert martial artist, as he easily subdues Alberto and Raquel on separate occasions. He is shown practicing boxing and undergoing intense physical training in his hideout.

            Despite planning the biggest heist in human history, the Professor maintains stringent moral principles. He refrains from killing Raquel's mother even when it appears to be the only possibility of survival for the heist. He maintains that not spilling blood is the most important rule of the heist. However, it is unclear if this is only due to consideration of public opinion, or if it arises from a moral standpoint. He also shows great compassion and love for his team members, despite beginning his heist classes with the 'No Personal Relationships' rule.
