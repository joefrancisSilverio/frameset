            Tokyo is a flirty and rebellious character, and she has a relationship with Rio, that stops and starts throughout the first heist. She shares a good friendship with Nairobi, the two having gotten drunk together many times. She doesn't like being told what to do and shows dislike for Berlin in the first series.

            Tokyo is reckless and impulsive, she usually acts before she thinks, which sometimes results in things she regrets. She let her relationship with Rio complicate the plans for the heist. She is quick to lose her patience, as well as sometimes being shown to quickly draw conclusions. She canâ€™t control her emotions very well and also expresses them intensely.

            She was the first to begin worrying when The Professor did not respond to the check-up calls, and almost immediately began taking extreme measures. She is, however, shown to care deeply for those whom she loves, as shown as when Rio is shot at the beginning of the show, and when she finds out her mother passed away. She can be very protective and loving with the people she truly cares about.

            Tokyo is confident and doesn't mind using her looks and sexuality to her advantage.
