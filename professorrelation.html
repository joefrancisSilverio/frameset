                Raquel first meets the Professor in a café near the Mint when he lends her his cell phone to call her mother. They become friends and eventually fall in love, unaware that he is the "mastermind" of the heist. When she finds out, she does everything possible to trick him and take him to jail, but he eventually convinces her and she gives in to his plan, letting him escape with the money and finding him a year later in Palawan, an island in the Philippines.

                The Professor was the first person that Tokyo meets in the crew, and was the one who saved her from spending her life in jail. Throughout the series, Tokyo has shown to greatly admire and respect The Professor, even going so far as to call him her 'guardian angel'.

                In a flashback of Berlin and the Professor in Italy, Berlin reveals that he has Helmer's Myopathy, a condition that his mother had as well. The doctors predicted that he would have 3 years to live, but Berlin is hopeful that he will have 6 or 7 years to live. The Professor immediately decides to call off the heist and find treatment for him abroad, but Berlin refuses as there is no cure and he preferred to continue with his passion - robbing.

They first meet at The Toledo House and get into an argument when Alberto drives the Professor back to Madrid. Their argument culminates in a fist fight which the Professor quickly wins.
