            Radko Dragić , better known by his alias Oslo, was a secondary character in the Netflix series Money Heist, portrayed by actor Roberto García. He was a robber and war veteran who participated in the Royal Mint of Spain heist.

            Oslo, like his cousin Helsinki, is a large man presumably due to both their backgrounds in war. However, he is slightly shorter and possibly less heavyset than Helsinki. He has a mohawk on top of his head, and sports a long scraggly beard rather than a full one like Helsinki.

            As remarked by Tokyo after his death, Oslo was the quietest robber out of the group. It is unknown if this is due to an introverted nature, or due to the fact he doesn't seem to be as adept at speaking Spanish as his cousin Helsinki (who is much more social), either only understanding simple sentences, or often having to rely on him to translate orders into Serbian. Oslo's impaired ability to speak Spanish is first revealed during a flashback in Part 1 in which the Professor is seen conversing with him in the background about learning new languages.

            Oslo seems to have a no-nonsense attitude to work, displaying a steely-eyed look and cold demeanor. Again, this could simply be due to the language barrier between him and the rest of the team. Oslo has been seen to have a lighter side however, dancing with cousin Helsinki during Moscow's song 'Maria, my love' and chuckling at Berlin's joke (admittedly, at Denver's expense) in Part 4 Episode 5.
