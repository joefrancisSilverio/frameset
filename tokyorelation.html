She had defied and challenged him on multiple occasions throughout the show, even going so far as to hold him at gunpoint to get him to do what she wanted. The height of her aggression with Berlin was when she played Russian Roulette with him in the bathroom, which drove Berlin to tie her to a cart and push her out of the Royal Mint.
