            Before joining the Robbers of The Royal Mint of Spain, Berlin was a jewel thief, with twenty-seven robberies to his name of jewelry stores, auction houses, and armored vehicles. His biggest theft, before the Royal Mint of Spain, was 434 diamonds in Champs-Élysées, Paris.

            Berlin is believed to be arrogant, narcissistic, and deemed to be a psychopath by his fellow crew, but he is shown to be extravagantly elegant, professional and charming. He is calm, patient as well as eloquent and plays mind games with some of the hostages. It is said that he has a pathological need to make a good impression.

            He has a sarcastic sense of humor, often mocking his fellow crew members and the hostages. Despite this, he greatly respects his fellow crew members and will do everything to save them, as shown in the finale of Part 2. Due to his disease, he is depressed from time to time and even suicidal in the end.
