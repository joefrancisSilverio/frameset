                After the first heist, they eloped together and spent time hiding on an island in the Caribbean. However, Tokyo eventually felt bored and desired to go to the city. When Tokyo forgets to call Rio, he stresses and repeatedly calls her. Unbeknownst to Rio, the cell phone was registered to him and his repeated calls allowed Interpol to trace his location, resulting in his arrest.

                Mónica became especially close with Rio during the heist of the Bank of Spain as Rio was experiencing PTSD as a result of the torture by Alicia Sierra. It was hard for him to open up to other crew members, so he turned to Mónica as she was more understanding and caring.
