            Nairobi (Ágata Jiménez) is a fictional character in the Netflix series Money Heist, portrayed by Alba Flores. She is the quality manager of the group, in charge of printing money in the Royal Mint of Spain in parts 1 and 2, and overseeing the melting of gold in the Bank of Spain in parts 3 and 4.

            Nairobi is enthusiastic, motivating and always active. She usually speaks loudly and clearly, so she leads the production of money very well. She can be somewhat impulsive from time to time, blindly accepting her son’s teddy bear with the potential threat of a bomb.

            She is also seen to be very perceptive as she pieces together the relationship of Berlin and Ariadna Cascales with a few cues. Out of the other robbers, she seems to be most kind hearted and empathetic as seen in her tendency to be easily affected by an emotional situation or other people's actions.

            Nairobi always has everyone's backs. She makes sure that they're feeling comfortable and doing the best that they can. This is most notable in 5 Minutes Earlier where she chooses to go down to Matías and the rest of the gold melters to reassure and motivate them instead of ensuring her own safety by going to the library with the rest of the hostages

            Nairobi is slightly romantic, as seen by her interactions with Helsinki and then Bogotá. She wants the idealistic family. In TKO, she expresses her desire for the professor to be the biological father of her child.
