            Rio is playful, naïve, and innocent compared to his fellow crew members, causing him to be considered the "weakest link". His naïvety caused problems, which drove the Professor to kick him out of the group, however Tokyo stopped it.

            Rio still cares for his family. He was upset upon hearing his parents talk about their disappointment and was emotional when he watched the video of his parents. He considered surrendering himself, but later decided to continue with the heist.

            Rio is a very skilled hacker, having attacked multiple websites and being recruited as the tech expert for a very complicated heist. He is shown to have enough knowledge of the deep web to know where he can buy weapons.

            Rio is shown to be at least a bit skilled with weapons, knowing how to use them. As stated by Alison Parker, he doesn’t hold a weapon like a professional. He is supposed to be skilled in all the things the professor taught him and his fellow crew members, although some have never been shown.
