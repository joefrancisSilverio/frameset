                Helsinki is Oslo's cousin, and together they fought in wars. Helsinki and Oslo are close, having traveled and done work together for a while before they are recruited by the Professor. Oslo trusts Helsinki enough to request Helsinki to kill him when he is put in a vegetive state.</p>
