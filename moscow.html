            Agustin Ramos, known by his code name Moscow ( Spanish: Moscú ), was one of the main protagonists in Part 1 and 2 of Money Heist. He was one of the eight robbers who went in to rob the Royal Mint of Spain and the father of Denver, another protagonist in the show.

            Moscow is a very gentle soul who cares a lot for others. He plays a sort of fatherly figure for not only Denver, but also Rio and Tokyo. He cares infinitely for Denver and is very protective of him as seen in Part 2, when he warns Denver about the relationship he is developing with Mónica Gaztambide.

            We also see that he is not afraid to voice the truth and his opinions when he needs to, like when he approached Tokyo after he saw her confront Alison Parker. He accuses her of always hurting the people closest to her and having the need to always move on. He tells her that she is probably already getting tired of Rio and is going to hurt him too.

            Despite his occasionally up-front personality, his personality is mostly defined by his caring and gentle nature, particularly with his son. He is shown to be reasonable and have a good moral compass. He is also shown to have a happy and fun side, even ambitious as we see it's his goal to release his song 'Maria, Mi Amor'(which eventually gets released by Part 3).
